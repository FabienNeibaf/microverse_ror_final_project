# Testing

We use RSPEC for testing.  
The integration test is done via _capybara-webkit_. In order to run the test inside _features_ folder you need to run rspec prefixed by `xvfb-run -a` command.

- `rspec spec/models` and `xvfb-run -a rspec spec/features`  
   _or just:_
- `xvfb-run -a rspec` to run all the tests in the same time.

:gem: When running **bundle install** _capybara-webkit_ gem will require some native extensions like Qt and others.  
Follow the instruction given here if you encounter difficulty during installation: _https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit/wiki/Installing-Qt-and-compiling-capybara-webkit_.
